    "text": "Hello! I’m Diego, a web developer with a passion for transforming ideas into exceptional digital experiences. I specialize in creating modern, functional, and visually appealing solutions that not only meet but exceed expectations. With experience in technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and more, I enjoy working on both the frontend and backend to deliver complete and well-integrated projects. My approach focuses on writing clean, optimized, and scalable code, ensuring that every detail is carefully handled. Besides programming, I love learning about new technologies and industry trends to stay up-to-date in a constantly evolving field. Whether collaborating with multidisciplinary teams or leading projects, I’m committed to bringing value and finding innovative solutions. When I’m not coding, you’ll likely find me exploring new tools, reading about user experience design, or enjoying a good coffee. If you’re looking for someone to bring your next web project to life, I’d be delighted to collaborate with you!"
